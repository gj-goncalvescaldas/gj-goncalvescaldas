Hello! I'm Gustavo João Gonçalves Caldas, a passionate programmer and data engineer. I created this GitHub repository because of my love for coding and to document my journey in software development and data engineering.

Although my GitHub is currently empty, it’s because I created this repository on June 10th, 2024. This date marks a significant milestone in my recovery journey from a serious accident on November 19th, 2023, which left me with a paralyzed hand and required three surgeries. Over the past months, my primary focus has been on my recovery.

Now that I’m gradually regaining my ability to use the computer, I’m excited to start working on GitHub again. I miss the joy of coding and the satisfaction of solving problems through technology. This repository will be a reflection of my progress and my dedication to getting back to my best self.

Thank you for visiting my profile. I appreciate your patience and interest in following my journey. Let's build something amazing together as I continue my path to recovery!
